# ByteFlip (TBL Endian Converter)

A small utility to convert `.tbl` mapping files from **big-endian** to **little-endian** (or vice versa) format.

Useful for retro game ROM hacking and translation tools, especially when dealing with text encoding on platforms like GBA that use little-endian byte ordering.

## üîß Features

- Reads a `.tbl` file with entries in the format `XXXX=VALUE`
- Converts the hexadecimal key from **big-endian** to **little-endian**
- Outputs a new `.tbl` file with updated key order, preserving values and comments

## üì¶ Usage

### Compile

```bash
gcc -o byteflip byteflip.c
```

### Run

```bash
./byteflip input.tbl output.tbl
```

- ```input.tbl```: The source table using big-endian keys (e.g., 0480=„Ç´)

- ```output.tbl```: The destination table using little-endian keys (e.g., 8004=„Ç´)

## üß™ Example

### Input: ```big.tbl```

```ini
0480=„Çø
0481=„ÉÅ
0482=„ÉÑ
```

### Output: ```little.tbl```

```ini
8004=„Çø
8104=„ÉÅ
8204=„ÉÑ
```
## üìÅ Notes

- Lines starting with # or empty lines are preserved.

- Keys are assumed to be 4-digit hexadecimal values.
